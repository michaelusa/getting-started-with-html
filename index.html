    <b><em><u>The Basics of Web HTML</b></em></u>
<br><em>Unit 1</em></br>
<br></br>
<b>WWW</b>
<p>The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The internet has been around since the 1990's & contains over 30 billion webpages. The major pieces of the world wide web include web browsers, the cloud, & servers.</p>

<b>HTML</b>
<br>HyperText Markup Language</br>
<p>HTML includes text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), references to other documents (e.g. - images & video), as well as links to other pages.</p>

<b>HTML Markup</b>
<p> i.e.- name(tag) + contents + name(tag) = element</p>

<b>More Tags</b>
<p>em - emphasis or italic</p>

<b>HTML Atttributes</b>
<br>(tag ATTR="value") contents (/tag)</br>
<br>anchor - (a) - link</br>
<br>(a href="www.redding.com") derp (/a)</br>
<br> Note: href is for the attribute name & between the quotation marks is the website url.</br>

<b>Images</b>
<br>images - (img)</br>
<br>(img src="url" alt="text")</br>
<br>**No closing tag**</br>

<b>White Space</b>
<br> break - (br) = non-box spreading of text through multiple lines</br>
<br> paragraph - (p) - box spreading of text through multiple lines</br>

<b>Incline/Block</b>
<br> br = inline, therfore e.g: text - (br) - text </br>
<br> p = block, therefore e.g.: (p) - text - (/p)</br>
<br> Note: blocked text includes a width & height component</br>

<b>Span/Div</b>
<br>Span = inline</br>
<br>(span class="foo")</br>
<br>Div = block</br>
<br>(div class="bar")</br>
<p></p>

<b>Review & Take-a-way</b>
  <br><em>1. What a webpage is.</em></br>
  <p>A webpage is a text doc written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents and then both interpret & display them.</p>
<br><em>2. How coding works.</br></em>
  <p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand. The computer can then follow the instructions that the programmer wrote.</p>
<br><em>3. Computers are stupid.</br></em>
<p>Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands (also known as writing with correct "syntax")</p>
<p> For example, if you forget to close a 'b' tag, the computer won't be able to figure out what you had intended to make bold.</p>

<br><em>4. Progammers can't remember everything.</br></em>
<p>There are too many details to keep everything in your head. And that's okay. If you forget how to make text italic in HTML, you can alwas just look it up.</p>
  
<br><em>5. Basic HTML Vocabulary</br></em>
<p>You will be using HTML in the next few lessons, so it will be helpful if you're comfortable with the jargon.</p>
<br>a. TAG: An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets ('p' for example) and a closing tag ('/p'). Some tags, called 'void' tags, do not require a closing tag (like the 'br' tag).</br> 

<br>b. ELEMENT: An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening & closing tags.</br>

<br>c. ATTRIBUTE: This is a property of an HTML element. For example, to set the 'href' attribute of another tag to the udacity URL, you would write (a href= 'www.udacity.com')</br>
